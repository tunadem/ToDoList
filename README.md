# ToDoList
Basic To-Do List

I am studying computer engineering currently. This is my first project. The code is quite messy and it is not optimal. Perhaps that will be fixed and adjusted later. The reason why I made this project is to improve myself. I dont see anyone using this program frequently. Anyways thank you for checking it out.

The program is a basic to-do list. You can add/edit/delete tasks from the list. You can check the checkboxes on the left of the tasks if you did the task. Tasks has title,description,date,time,importance level. You can search any task. You can sort the tasks by importance level/duetime/not completed ones. Edit method works a little bit odd. It was not a problem before I created an exe file. After editing selecting another task with your cursor will update the visual of the task list. Its just visual so nothing to worry about. The program saves your tasks information to a .json file, I had a lot of problems about this. The problem is fixed but not the way I wanted. So the .json file's location is a little bit odd.

Overall, I am happy with the program. I learned quite few things that satisfy me the most.
